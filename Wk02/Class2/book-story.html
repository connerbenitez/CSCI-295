        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an<br>
            hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of<br>
            <em>Nature, New Scientist, </em>and all the other scientific<br>
            journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed<br>
            copy of On The Road. It had been Molly's favourite<br>
            book since college, and the longer she spent in these<br>
            four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting<br>
            under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming<br>
            that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing<br></br.>
            better to do".</p>
